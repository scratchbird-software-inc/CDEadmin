# ScratchRobin CDE Admin

**ScratchRobin CDE Admin** is the project's formal name. The product is called
**ScratchRobin**, **SR**, or **CDEadmin** where a shorter name is appropriate.
It is an independent hard fork of pgAdmin 4 9.17 and is being developed as a
multi-engine, multi-model administration and development environment for
ScratchBird and independently operated database engines.

CDEadmin is not pgAdmin 4 and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the
pgAdmin Development Team. The upstream copyright, PostgreSQL Licence, source
history, and applicable notices are retained. See [NOTICE](NOTICE),
[LICENSE](LICENSE), and [Hard-fork status](docs/en_US/cdeadmin_hard_fork.rst).

## Developer setup

For a fresh development machine, see the
[Windows/macOS/Linux development and demo setup guide](tools/development/README.md).
It covers dependencies, frontend builds, account setup, Docker fixtures, sample
credentials, and per-engine start/stop/verification commands.

## Why this is a hard fork

The project is no longer a PostgreSQL-only administration tool with additional
connection adapters. Its product architecture and administration model now
diverge materially from upstream pgAdmin 4:

- A provider contract represents engine identity, capabilities, metadata,
  object lifecycles, query languages, data editing, health, and operations.
- ScratchBird is a native engine. Its legacy-protocol endpoints are handled by
  the same provider as the corresponding native reference engine; there is no
  special “emulation mode” in the UI.
- Relational, document, graph, key-value, analytic, search, columnar, temporal,
  and distributed/control-plane workloads can have purpose-built workspaces.
- Visual administration is capability-driven instead of assuming a
  PostgreSQL object hierarchy or SQL grammar.
- Cross-model queries, semantic models, cubes, operational workflows, and
  audit records are first-class product concepts.
- CDEadmin uses separate state, package, cookie, desktop-store, update, and
  signing namespaces so it can coexist with pgAdmin 4.

The repository is independently developed and does not merge from, track, or
submit changes to pgAdmin. Its retained Git history records provenance and is
not an integration promise. GitHub may continue to display a fork relationship
until a repository administrator uses *Settings -> General -> Danger Zone ->
Leave fork network*. That hosting metadata has no effect on the local remote or
build. Detachment is permanent and can discard GitHub-hosted metadata such as
issues, pull requests, wikis, stars, watchers and comments, so that separate
hosting action must be backed up and reviewed before it is performed.

## Current development status

CDEadmin is currently version **0.1.0-dev** and is not approved for production
release. The current implementation checkpoint provides 24 connector roots and
26 independently activated provider profiles; YugabyteDB YSQL/YCQL and
OpenSearch native/SQL-PPL have separate protocol profiles.

The provider portfolio covers PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Firebird, DuckDB,
SQLite, MongoDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, Redis, XTDB, ClickHouse, InfluxDB, Milvus,
OpenSearch, Apache Ignite, CockroachDB, Dolt, FoundationDB, immudb, TiDB, TiKV,
Vitess, and YugabyteDB. Native ScratchBird is intentionally deferred until the
reference-engine browser audit is complete.

The structural and live-operation gates are implementation checkpoints, not a
claim of release readiness. Remaining qualification includes exhaustive
provider-by-provider browser review, every form and material state, accessibility
variants, connection/security mode matrices, large-result behavior, and final
packaging, legal, security, and release-engineering approval. See
[Implementation status](docs/en_US/implementation_status.rst).

The current implementation contains provider and administration work for
multiple engine families. Feature availability is governed by provider
capability and activation gates; a listed engine should not be interpreted as
fully production-ready unless its gates pass.

## Product identity and compatibility names

All active user-facing product surfaces must say **CDEadmin** and use generic,
engine-neutral artwork. Engine names such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebird, or
ClickHouse remain where they describe an actual engine, its features, or its
documentation.

Some inherited identifiers remain temporarily for compatibility, including
the Python package `pgadmin`, JavaScript object `pgAdmin`, compatibility
launcher `web/pgAdmin4.py`, selected route/module IDs, migration names, and
some
`PGADMIN_` configuration variables. Renaming these without a migration layer
would break imports, extensions, deployments, or user state. They are legacy
implementation interfaces, not the product name. New project-owned code must
use `CDEadmin`, `cdeadmin`, or `CDEADMIN_` as appropriate.

Run the identity and attribution gate with:

```bash
python3 tools/cdeadmin_product_identity.py --source .
python3 -m unittest tools.tests.test_cdeadmin_product_identity
```

## Architecture

CDEadmin retains the proven Flask/Python server, React client, and Electron
desktop runtime inherited from pgAdmin 4. The CDEadmin provider layer extends
that foundation with:

- engine/provider registration and capability discovery;
- connection-profile and driver contracts;
- provider-defined object catalogs and safe operation descriptors;
- form/workspace schemas for visual administration;
- SQL and non-SQL query execution contracts;
- data-grid editing and provider-specific mutation semantics;
- semantic-model and analytic workspace contracts;
- distributed control-plane operations, approvals, progress, cancellation,
  redaction, persistence, and audit evidence.

The application shell is governed by the CDEadmin module, service, capability,
contribution, command, event, diagnostics, and surface registries. Its
Zero-Grey design system supplies token-driven light/dark and accessibility
profiles, semantic controls, standard dialogs, persistent layouts, keyboard
commands, project assets, and detachable/restorable work surfaces. The bundled
Interface Designer lets each account edit reviewed fonts, colours, relative
geometry, density, motion, semantic artwork assignments, menu structure, and
authorized command placement. Portable validated profiles support personal,
team, and organization baselines without embedding executable code or
weakening command permissions. Product, engine, authentication, and command
artwork is held in the canonical
`web/pgadmin/static/assets/cdeadmin` catalog; new code uses semantic icon
identities instead of physical asset paths.

The bundled
DDN Viewer and DDN Designer are consumed as versioned third-party libraries
through their documented public APIs; editable DDN source remains the single
diagram authority and is stored as an authenticated, versioned project asset.
The first-party Schema Comparison, Data Lineage, Data Quality, Data Contract
Manager, ETL Designer, CDC Designer, Replication Topology and Distributed
Tracing modules use those same registries,
project revisions, provider evidence envelopes, task lifecycle, permission
checks, accessible workbench surfaces, and explicit unknown/unsupported
states. ETL adds typed batch/stream ports, native-to-semantic mappings, bounded
no-write preview, explicit pushdown planning, provider-bound deployment
validation, checkpoint recovery, error routing and declared/observed lineage.
CDC adds exact provider capture mechanisms, separate snapshot/stream
checkpoints, proof-gated delivery guarantees, safe schema evolution, bounded
and permission-redacted event inspection, lag alerts and independently
confirmed replay. None of these modules infers behavior from protocol or
engine-family similarity.
Replication Topology preserves exact provider-native participant roles,
states, positions, mechanisms and lag evidence beside its deliberately small
normalized vocabulary. It provides layout-only topology interaction, bounded
lag history and alerts, provider-mediated link control, immutable snapshots,
and a failover workflow that requires quorum, candidate, position and
data-loss evidence before arming an exact plan revision. A completed failover
is accepted only after provider rediscovery matches the expected topology.
Distributed Tracing preserves OpenTelemetry trace/span identity and unknown
attributes, applies sensitivity policy before persistence, and keeps runtime
telemetry separate from deterministic project definitions. It provides
bounded trace search, hierarchical waterfalls, span inspection, observed-time
service maps, evidenced query/resource correlation, source and sampling
administration, and provenance-bearing OTLP export. Provider-native tracing is
enabled only by an exact adapter contract; internal CDEadmin spans remain a
valid independent source.

The activated AI Interface uses dedicated connector identities and governed
tool, data-egress, approval, budget, retention, query-review, result-handle and
audit authorities. It cannot borrow a signed-in user's database session, expose
raw credentials, approve its own consequential action, or advertise a
connector class without an implementation. The activated Data Discovery and
Intelligence module provides security-trimmed lexical, facet, semantic and
graph discovery; deterministic ranking; project-backed business knowledge,
saved work and administration assets; governed access, certification,
profiling, curation and analytics; and all specified Discovery workbench
surfaces. Provider index sources, provider grant execution, live curation,
visibility diagnostics and AI enrichment remain capability-gated until their
real authorities are registered. System-catalog-only resources are not
presented as business discovery content.
See [UI architecture](web/pgadmin/static/js/cdeadmin_ui/ARCHITECTURE.md).

PostgreSQL support remains a core engine provider, but it does not define the
global product identity or constrain other providers to PostgreSQL semantics.
See [Product architecture](docs/en_US/cdeadmin_architecture.rst) for the
provider, endpoint, object, workspace, command, and verification boundaries.

## Source tree

- `web/` — Flask application, React UI, provider implementations, tests.
- `web/pgadmin/cdeadmin/` — CDEadmin-owned provider, administration,
  workspace, and product-identity code.
- `runtime/` — Electron desktop runtime.
- `pkg/` — packaging inputs.
- `docs/` — product and inherited engine documentation.
- `tools/` — validation, activation-gate, and engineering utilities.

The historical `pgadmin` directory name is part of the compatibility boundary
described above.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later
- Node.js 20 or later
- Yarn through Corepack
- The Python and native drivers required by the providers being exercised
- Live reference engines only for the relevant integration/activation tests

Enable Yarn and create a Python environment:

```bash
corepack enable
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -r web/regression/requirements.txt
```

Provider-specific drivers and reference-engine versions are documented by
their activation plans and tests. Do not silently substitute an engine or
driver version when collecting conformance evidence.

## Building web assets

```bash
make install-node
make bundle
```

On Windows, run `yarn install` and `yarn run bundle` from `web/`.

## Development configuration and startup

Local overrides belong in `web/config_local.py`. CDEadmin defaults should use
separate paths and ports from pgAdmin 4. The product identity contract reserves
port 5051 and `cdeadmin` state namespaces for this purpose.

Initialize the configuration database and run the inherited compatibility
launcher:

```bash
python3 web/setup.py
python3 web/CDEadmin.py
```

`CDEadmin.py` is the canonical launcher. `pgAdmin4.py` remains as a temporary
compatibility entry point for inherited imports and deployments.

## Tests

Run the narrow test suites associated with changed providers and UI modules,
then the broader Python and JavaScript suites appropriate to the change. The
identity gate is mandatory for changes to branding, packaging, About, runtime,
or documentation.

The portable [reference-engine demonstration estate](tools/reference_engine_demos/README.md)
contains pinned lifecycle configuration, native sample-data adapters, rendered
connection profiles, and verification for every reference product except the
intentionally deferred native ScratchBird engine.

Generated reports, workplans, and test evidence for this programme are kept
outside the repository under `~/Sandbox/pgadmin4_work_area/`. Product code is
changed in this repository. ScratchBird source and private specifications are
read-only inputs and must never be modified by CDEadmin work.

## Documentation

Build the documentation with:

```bash
python3 -m pip install Sphinx sphinxcontrib-youtube
make docs
```

The output is written to `docs/en_US/_build/html/`. The documentation landing
page, product architecture, connector model, interface, deployment, governance,
and status pages describe CDEadmin. Retained pgAdmin release notes and
PostgreSQL-object chapters are preserved for provenance and for the PostgreSQL
provider; they are explicitly labelled and do not define CDEadmin globally.

## Packaging status

CDEadmin package identifiers and state namespaces have been reserved, but
independent signing keys and update endpoints are unassigned. Packages are not
approved for release until product, legal, security, and release-engineering
gates have been completed. Never reuse pgAdmin signing identities, update
feeds, package identifiers, or artwork.
